        <Title>Crop production</Title>
        <Superscript />
        <Definition>This subsector comprises establishments, such as farms, orchards, groves, greenhouses and nurseries, primarily engaged in growing crops, plants, vines, trees and their seeds (excluding those engaged in forestry operations). Industries have been created taking into account input factors, such as suitable land, climatic conditions, type of equipment, and the amount and type of labour required. The production process is typically completed when the raw product or commodity grown reaches the farm gate for market, that is, at the point of first sale or price determination. Establishments in these industries may use traditional crop production methods, employ modified or improved crop inputs, or engage in organic crop production.

An establishment is classified within this subsector provided that 50 percent or more of the establishment's agricultural production consists of crops. Establishments with 50 percent or more crop production and with no one product or family of products accounting for 50 percent of the production are treated as combination crop farms and classified to 11199 All other crop farming, except if 50 percent or more of the production is a combination of oilseeds and grains, in which case they are classified to 11119 Other grain farming.</Definition>

        <Title>Forestry and logging</Title>
        <Superscript />
        <Definition>This subsector comprises establishments primarily engaged in growing and harvesting timber on a long production cycle (of ten years or more). Long production cycles use different production processes than short production cycles, which require more horticultural interventions prior to harvest, resulting in processes more similar to those found in the Crop production subsector. Consequently, Christmas tree production and other production involving production cycles of less than ten years, are classified to the Crop production subsector.

Industries in this subsector specialize in different stages of the production cycle. Reforestation requires production of seedlings in specialized nurseries. Timber production requires natural forests or suitable areas of land that are available for a long duration. The maturation time for timber depends upon the species of tree, the climatic conditions of the region, and the intended purpose of the timber. The harvesting of timber, except when done on an extremely small scale, requires specialized machinery unique to the industry. The gathering of forest products, such as gums, barks, balsam needles and Spanish moss, are also included in this subsector.</Definition>

        <Superscript />
        <Definition>This subsector comprises establishments primarily engaged in catching fish and other wild animals from their natural habitats. These establishments are dependent upon a continued supply of the natural resource. The catching of fish is the predominant economic activity of this subsector and it usually requires specialized vessels that, by the nature of their size, configuration and equipment, are not suitable for any other type of production, such as transportation. Hunting and trapping utilize a wide variety of production processes and are classified in the same subsector as fishing because the availability of resources and the constraints imposed, such as conservation requirements and proper habitat maintenance, are similar.</Definition>

        <Title>Construction</Title>
        <Superscript />
        <Definition>This sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in constructing, repairing and renovating buildings and engineering works, and in subdividing and developing land. These establishments may operate on their own account or under contract to other establishments or property owners. They may produce complete projects or just parts of projects. Establishments often subcontract some or all of the work involved in a project, or work together in joint ventures. Establishments may produce new construction, or undertake repairs and renovations to existing structures.

A construction establishment may be the only establishment of an enterprise, or one of several establishments of an integrated real estate enterprise engaged in the land assembly, development, financing, building and sale of large projects.

There are substantial differences in the types of equipment, work force skills, and other inputs required by establishments in this sector. To highlight these differences and variations in the underlying production functions, this sector is divided into three subsectors. Establishments are distinguished initially between those that undertake projects that require several different construction activities (known as trades) to be performed, and establishments that specialize in one trade.

The former are classified in subsectors 236 Construction of buildings and 237 Heavy and civil engineering construction, depending upon whether they are primarily engaged in the construction of buildings or in heavy construction and civil engineering projects. Establishments in these subsectors complete projects using their own labour force, by subcontracting, usually to trade contractors, or a combination of own account and subcontracting activities. Establishments classified in these subsectors are known by a variety of designations, such as general contractor, design-builder, speculative builder, operative builder and construction manager. The designation depends on the scope of the projects they undertake, the degree of responsibility and risk that they assume, the type of structure that they produce, and whether they work on contract for an owner or on their own account.

General contractors typically work under contract to a client (the owner of the land and the building or structure to be constructed), and undertake projects that require several specialized construction activities to be performed. Often the general contractor will subcontract some of the specialized tasks to other establishments.

Design-builders are similar to general contractors. However, in a design-build project a single contract is signed with the owner that makes the contractor responsible for providing the architectural and engineering designs. The design-builder therefore is responsible for the design of the project as well as its construction.

Construction establishments that build on their own account, for sale to others, are known as speculative builders, operative builders or merchant builders. They are most often engaged in the construction of residential buildings.

Construction managers provide oversight and scheduling services to the owner, for the most part during the actual construction process. This type of service is sometimes referred to as agency construction management, to distinguish it from a type of general contracting known as at-risk construction management. On the other hand, project management, which is a turnkey-type service involving the entire project, including feasibility studies, the arranging of financing, and the management of the contract bidding and selection process, is classified in 54133 Engineering services when it is the primary activity of an establishment.

Establishments that specialize in one particular construction activity, or trade, are generally classified in subsector 238 Specialty trade contractors. However, in order to conform to the generally accepted distinctions made by construction businesses themselves, some types of specialized establishments involved in road building and civil engineering are classified in subsector 237 Heavy and civil engineering construction.

Subsector 238, Specialty trade contractors, comprises establishments engaged in trade activities generally needed in the construction of buildings and structures, such as masonry, painting, or electrical work. Specialty trade contractors usually work under contract to another construction establishment but, especially in renovation and repair construction, they may contract directly with the owner of the property.

A significant amount of construction work is performed by enterprises that are primarily engaged in some business other than construction, for these enterprises' own use, using employees and equipment of the enterprise. This activity is not included in the construction sector unless the construction work performed is the primary activity of a separate establishment of the enterprise. However, if separate establishments do exist, they are classified in the construction sector.</Definition>

        <Definition>This subsector comprises establishments primarily engaged in the construction of buildings. Buildings are distinguished by their primary function, such as residential, commercial and industrial. Establishments may produce new construction, or undertake additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs to existing structures. The on-site assembly of precast, panelized, and prefabricated buildings and construction of temporary buildings are included in this subsector. Part or all of the production work for which the establishments in this subsector have responsibility may be subcontracted to other construction establishments - usually specialty trade contractors.</Definition>

        <Superscript />
        <Definition>This subsector comprises establishments whose primary activity is the construction of entire engineering projects (e.g., highways and dams), and specialty trade contractors, whose primary activity is the production of a specific component for such projects. Establishments may produce new construction, or undertake additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs to existing structures and works. Establishments in this subsector are classified based on the types of structures that they construct.

Specialty trade contractors in this subsector generally provide specialized services of a type related to heavy and civil engineering construction projects and not normally performed on buildings or building related projects. For example, specialized equipment is needed to paint lines on highways. This equipment is not normally used in building applications so the activity is classified in this subsector. Traffic signal installation, while specific to highways, uses much of the same skills and equipment that are needed for electrical work in building projects and is therefore classified in subsector 238 Specialty trade contractors.

Construction projects involving water resources (e.g., dredging and land drainage) and projects involving open space improvement (e.g., parks and trails) are included in this subsector. Establishments whose primary activity is the subdivision of land into individual building lots usually perform various additional site-improvement activities (e.g., road building and utility line installation) and are included in this subsector.</Definition>

        <Definition>This subsector comprises establishments primarily engaged in trade activities generally needed in the construction of buildings and structures, such as masonry, painting, or electrical work. The work performed may include new work, additions, alterations, maintenance, and repairs. Specialty trade contractors usually work under contract to general contractors or operative builders to carry out a component of an overall project. However, they may contract directly with the owner of the property, especially in renovation and repair construction.

Not all specialized trade activities are classified in this subsector. In order to conform to the generally accepted distinctions made by construction businesses themselves, some types of specialized establishments involved in heavy and civil engineering construction are classified in subsector 237 Heavy and civil engineering construction.

Usually most of the work is carried out at the construction site. Some trade contractors operate shops in which they carry out job-specific prefabrication and other work. However, establishments that manufacture structural components such as steel and pre-cast concrete, or that manufacture building equipment such as boilers and elevators, are classified in sector 31-33 Manufacturing even if they install these goods themselves.

The specialized activities classified in this subsector range from the initial site preparation for new construction, through the construction of building foundations and structures, the installation of building equipment and systems, to the finishing of buildings and other structures.</Definition>

        <Title>Manufacturing</Title>
        <Superscript />
        <Definition>This sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in the chemical, mechanical or physical transformation of materials or substances into new products. These products may be finished, in the sense that they are ready to be used or consumed, or semi-finished, in the sense of becoming a raw material for an establishment to use in further manufacturing. Related activities, such as the assembly of the component parts of manufactured goods; the blending of materials; and the finishing of manufactured products by dyeing, heat-treating, plating and similar operations are also treated as manufacturing activities. Manufacturing establishments are known by a variety of trade designations, such as plants, factories or mills.

Manufacturing establishments may own the materials which they transform or they may transform materials owned by other establishments. Manufacturing may take place in factories or in workers' homes, using either machinery or hand tools.

Units that completely outsource the transformation process but own the input materials are classified to the manufacturing sector. Units that completely outsource the transformation process but do not own the materials are classified to merchant wholesalers in Sector 41 Wholesale trade. These units are in fact buying the completed goods from the producer with the intention to resell it. These units may design the goods being manufactured, and may have some say in the manufacturing process.

Certain activities involving the transformation of goods are classified in other sectors. Some examples are post-harvest activities of agricultural establishments, such as crop drying; logging; the beneficiating of mineral ores; the production of structures by construction establishments; and various activities conducted by retailers, such as meat cutting and the assembly of products such as bicycles and computers.

Sales branches or offices (but not retail stores) maintained by manufacturing, refining, or mining enterprises apart from their plants or mines for the purpose of marketing their products are included in Sector 41 Wholesale trade as merchant wholesalers.</Definition>

        <Definition>This subsector comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing industrial and commercial machinery. These establishments assemble parts into components, subassemblies and complete machines. They may make the parts themselves, using general metal-working processes, or purchase them.

Establishments tend to specialize in producing machinery designed for particular applications, and this is reflected in the structure of the industry groups and industries. A broad distinction exists between general-purpose machinery, that is designed to be used in a variety of industrial applications, such as pumping or machining, and special-purpose machinery, that is designed to be used in a particular industry, such as agriculture or printing. The first three industry groups consist of establishments that produce special-purpose machinery. Establishments that produce general-purpose machinery are classified in the remaining industry groups.

Establishments primarily engaged in rebuilding machinery are included in the same industry as establishments manufacturing the particular type of new machinery. Unless otherwise specified, establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing parts, designed for use solely or principally with a particular machine, are classified in the same industry as establishments manufacturing that type of machinery.</Definition>

        <Definition>This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing computers and computer peripheral equipment.

Computers can be digital, analogue or hybrid. Digital computers, the most common type, are devices that can do all of the following: (1) store the processing program or programs and the data immediately necessary for the execution of the program; (2) be freely programmed in accordance with the requirements of the user; (3) perform arithmetical computations specified by the user; and (4) execute, without human intervention, a processing program that requires the computer to modify its execution, by logical decision, during the processing run. Analogue computers are capable of simulating mathematical models and comprise, at least, analogue, control and programming elements.

Peripherals are assemblies of components that are self-contained, but designed for use with computers. For purposes of classification, a peripheral must consist of more than a loaded circuit board. Peripheral equipment may be installed inside or outside the computer's housing. Important types of peripheral equipment are input-output devices, such as monitors, keyboards, mice and joysticks; storage devices, such as disk drives and CD-ROM readers; and printers. Dumb computer terminals, automated teller machines (ATM's), point-of-sale (POS) terminals and bar code scanners are treated as peripheral equipment.

Computers and peripheral equipment may be sold complete or in kits to be assembled by the purchaser.</Definition>

        <Title>Furniture and related product manufacturing</Title>
        <Superscript />
        <Definition>This subsector comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing furniture and related products. The processes used in the manufacture of furniture are standard methods of forming materials and assembling components, including cutting, moulding and laminating. The design of the article, for both aesthetic and functional qualities, is an important aspect of the production process. Design services may be performed by the furniture establishment's own work force or may be purchased from industrial designers. Furniture is classified based on the application for which it is designed. For example, an upholstered sofa is treated as household furniture, although it may also be used in hotels or offices.

Furniture is also classified according to the component material from which it is made. Furniture made from more than one material is classified based on the material used in the frame, or if there is no frame, the predominant component material. Upholstered household furniture is classified as such, without regard to the frame material.

Furniture may be produced on a stock or custom basis and may be shipped assembled or unassembled (knockdown). Establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing furniture frames and parts are included.</Definition>

        <Title>Wholesale trade</Title>
        <Superscript />
        <Definition>This sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in wholesaling merchandise, generally without transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise.

The wholesaling process is an intermediate step in the distribution of goods. Many wholesalers are organized to sell merchandise in large quantities to retailers, and business and institutional clients. However, some wholesalers, in particular those that supply non-consumer capital goods, sell merchandise in single units to final users.

Sales of capital goods or durable non-consumer goods used in the production of goods and services, such as farm machinery and equipment, heavy duty trucks, and industrial machinery, are always included in wholesale trade.

Wholesalers sell merchandise to other businesses and normally operate from a warehouse or office. These warehouses and offices are characterized by having little or no display of merchandise. In addition, neither the design nor the location of the premises is intended to solicit walk-in traffic. Wholesalers do not normally use advertising directed to the general public. Customers are generally reached initially via telephone, in-person marketing, or by specialized advertising that may include Internet and other electronic means. Follow-up are either vendor-initiated or client initiated, generally based on previous sales, and typically exhibit strong ties between sellers and buyers.

This sector comprises two main types of wholesalers: merchant wholesalers that sell goods on own account and wholesale electronic markets, agents, and brokers that arrange sales and purchases for others generally for a commission or fee.

Merchants wholesalers

Merchant wholesalers buy and sell merchandise on their own account, that is, they take title to the goods they sell. They generally operate from warehouse or office locations and they may ship from their own inventory or arrange for the shipment of goods directly from the supplier to the client. In addition to the sale of goods, they may provide, or arrange for the provision of, logistics, marketing and support services, such as packaging and labelling, inventory management, shipping, handling of warranty claims, in-store or co-op promotions, and product training.

Merchants wholesalers are known by a variety of trade designations depending on their relationship with suppliers or customers, or the distribution method they employ. Examples include wholesale merchants, wholesale distributors, drop shippers, rack-jobbers, import-export merchants, and banner wholesalers.

Included as merchant wholesalers are sales branches or offices (but not retail stores) maintained by manufacturing, refining, or mining enterprises apart from their plants or mines for the purpose of marketing their products.

Merchant wholesalers also include units that completely outsource the transformation process but do not own the input materials. These units are in fact buying the completed good from the producer with the intention to resell it. These units may design the goods being manufactured, and may have some say in the manufacturing process. On the other hand, units that completely outsource the transformation process but own the inputs are classified to the manufacturing sector.

The first eight subsectors of wholesale trade comprise merchant wholesalers. The grouping of these establishments into industry groups and industries is based on the merchandise line or lines supplied by the wholesaler.

Business-to business electronic markets, and agents and brokers

Business-to business electronic markets, and wholesale trade agents and brokers arrange for the purchase or sale of goods owned by others, generally for a commission or fee. They are known as business-to-business (B2B) electronic markets, wholesale trade agents and brokers, commission merchants, import-export agents and brokers, auction companies, and manufacturer's representatives. These establishments operate from offices and generally do not own or handle the goods they sell.</Definition>

        <Title>Retail trade</Title>
        <Superscript />
        <Definition>This sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in retailing merchandise, generally without transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise.

The retailing process is the final step in the distribution of merchandise; retailers are therefore organized to sell merchandise in small quantities to the general public.

Internet retail, direct selling, and mail-order retail are not separately classified from traditional in-store (also known as "brick and mortar") retail. Units that engage in retailing by any of these methods are classified based on the type of good sold. Meanwhile, vending machine operators are grouped with convenience retailers.

In addition to selling merchandise, some types of retailers are also engaged in the provision of after-sales services, such as repair and installation. For example, new automobile dealers, electronic and appliance retailers and musical instrument and supplies retailers often provide repair services, while floor covering stores and window treatment retailers often provide installation services. As a general rule, establishments engaged in retailing merchandise and providing after sales services are classified in this sector.</Definition>

        <Superscript />
        <Definition>This subsector comprises establishments primarily engaged in operating general merchandise, refrigerated and other warehousing and storage facilities. Included in this subsector are third-party warehouses serving retail chains and wholesalers. Establishments in this subsector provide facilities to store goods for customers. They do not take title to the goods they handle. These establishments take responsibility for storing the goods and keeping them secure. They may also provide a range of services, often referred to as logistics services, related to the distribution of a customer's goods. Logistics services can include labelling, breaking bulk, inventory control and management, light assembly, order entry and fulfillment, packaging, pick and pack, price marking and ticketing and transportation arrangement. However, establishments in this subsector always provide storage services in addition to any logistics services. Furthermore, the storage of goods must be more than incidental to the performance of a service such as price marking.

Both public and contract warehousing are included in this subsector. Public warehousing generally provides short-term storage, typically for less than thirty days. Contract warehousing generally involves a longer-term contract, often including the provision of logistical services and dedicated facilities.

Bonded warehousing and storage services, and warehouses located in free trade zones, are included in the industries of this subsector. However, storage services primarily associated with the provision of credit are not.</Definition>

        <Definition>This sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in producing and distributing (except by wholesale and retail methods) information and cultural products. Establishments providing the means to transmit or distribute these products or providing access to equipment and expertise for processing data are also included.

The unique characteristics of information and cultural products, and of the processes involved in their production and distribution, distinguish this sector from the goods-producing and services-producing sectors.

The value of these products lies in their information, educational, cultural or entertainment content, not in the format in which they are distributed. Distribution of these information and cultural products via the Internet are included. Most of these products are protected from unlawful reproduction by copyright laws. Only those possessing the rights to these works are authorized to reproduce, alter, improve and distribute them. Acquiring and using these rights often involves significant costs.

The intangible nature of the content of information and cultural products allows for their distribution in various forms. For example, a movie can be shown at a movie theatre, on a television broadcast, through video on demand, or rented online; a sound recording can be aired on radio, distributed online, or sold at a record store; software can be bought at retail outlets or downloaded from the Internet; a newspaper can be purchased at a newsstand or read online. In addition, improvements in information technology are revolutionizing the distribution of these products. The inclusion in this sector of telecommunications services providers reflects the increasingly important role these establishments play in making these products accessible to the public.

The main components of this sector are the motion picture and sound recording industries, the publishing industries, the broadcasting and content providers industries, the telecommunications industries, the computing infrastructure providers, data processing and hosting services industries, and the web search portals, libraries, archives, and other information services industries.

There are establishments engaged in culture-related activities that are classified in other sectors of NAICS. The most important are listed as exclusions below.</Definition>

        <Definition>This sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in financial transactions (that is, transactions involving the creation, liquidation, or change in ownership of financial assets) or in facilitating financial transactions. Included are:

- establishments that are primarily engaged in financial intermediation. They raise funds by taking deposits and/or issuing securities, and, in the process, incur liabilities, which they use to acquire financial assets by making loans and/or purchasing securities. Putting themselves at risk, they channel funds from lenders to borrowers and transform or repackage the funds with respect to maturity, scale and risk.

- establishments that are primarily engaged in the pooling of risk by underwriting annuities and insurance. They collect fees (insurance premiums or annuity considerations), build up reserves, invest those reserves and make contractual payments. Fees are based on the expected incidence of the insured risk and the expected return on investment.

- establishments that are primarily engaged in providing specialized services that facilitate or support financial intermediation, insurance and employee benefit programs.

In addition, establishments charged with monetary control - the monetary authorities - are included in this sector.</Definition>

        <Superscript />
        <Definition>This subsector comprises establishments primarily engaged in renting or leasing tangible goods, such as automobiles, computers, consumer goods, and industrial machinery and equipment, to customers in return for a periodic payment.

The subsector includes two main types of establishments:

- those that are engaged in renting consumer goods and equipment; and
- those that are engaged in leasing machinery and equipment of the kind often used for business operations.

The first type typically operates from a retail-like or store-front facility and maintains inventories of goods that are rented for short periods of time.

The latter type typically does not operate from retail-like locations or maintain inventories, and offers longer-term leases. These establishments work directly with clients by providing or arranging financing to enable them to acquire the use of equipment on a lease basis; or they work with equipment vendors or dealers to support the marketing of equipment to their customers under lease arrangements. Equipment lessors generally structure lease contracts to meet the specialized needs of their clients and use their remarketing expertise to find other users for previously leased equipment. Establishments that provide operating and financial leases are included in this subsector.</Definition>

        <Definition>This sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in activities in which human capital is the major input. These establishments make available the knowledge and skills of their employees, often on an assignment basis. The individual industries of this sector are defined on the basis of the particular expertise and training of the service provider.

The main components of this sector are legal services; accounting, tax preparation, bookkeeping and payroll services; architectural, engineering and related services; specialized design services; computer systems design and related services; management, scientific and technical consulting services; scientific research and development services; and advertising, public relations, and related services.

The distinguishing feature of this sector is the fact that most of the industries grouped in it have production processes that are almost wholly dependent on worker skills. In most of these industries, equipment and materials are not of major importance. Thus, the establishments classified in this sector sell expertise. Much of the expertise requires a university or college education, though not in every case.

Establishments primarily engaged in providing instruction and training in a wide variety of subjects and those primarily engaged in providing health care by diagnosis and treatment are not included in this sector.</Definition>

        <Definition>This sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing instruction and training in a wide variety of subjects. This instruction and training is provided by specialized establishments, such as schools, colleges, universities and training centres. These establishments may be privately owned and operated, either for profit or not, or they may be publicly owned and operated. They may also offer food and accommodation services to their students.

Educational services are usually delivered by teachers who explain, tell, demonstrate, supervise and direct self-learning. Instruction is imparted in diverse settings, such as educational institutions, the workplace or the home (through correspondence, television or other means). The lessons can be adapted to the particular needs of the students, for example sign language can replace verbal language for teaching students with hearing impairments. All industries in the sector share this commonality of process, namely, labour inputs of teachers with the requisite subject matter expertise and teaching ability.</Definition>

        <Definition>This subsector comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing instruction and training in a wide variety of subjects. This instruction and training is provided by specialized establishments, such as schools, colleges, universities and training centres.

The subsector is structured according to the level and type of educational services provided. Elementary and secondary schools, community colleges, Collèges d'enseignement général et professionnel (C.E.G.E.P.s) and universities correspond to a recognized series of formal levels of education designated by diplomas, associate degrees (and equivalent certificates) and degrees. The remaining industry groups are based on the type of instruction or training offered and the levels are not always as formally defined. The establishments are often highly specialized, many offering instruction in a very limited subject matter, for example, ski lessons or one specific type of software.

Within the subsector, the level and types of training that are required of the instructors and teachers vary depending on the industry.</Definition>

        <Superscript />
        <Definition>This subsector comprises establishments primarily engaged in producing, or organizing and promoting, live presentations that involve the performances of actors and actresses, singers, dancers, musical groups and artists, athletes and other entertainers. This subsector also includes independent (freelance) entertainers and artists and the establishments that manage their careers. The classification recognizes four basic processes: producing events; organizing and promoting events; managing and representing entertainers; and providing the artistic, creative and technical skills necessary for the production of artistic products and live performances.

This subsector makes a clear distinction between performing arts companies and performing artists (independents). Although not unique to arts and entertainment, freelancing is a particularly important phenomenon in this subsector; however, it is difficult to implement in the case of musical groups (companies) and artists, especially pop groups. These establishments tend to be more loosely organized and it can be difficult to distinguish companies from freelancers. Therefore, this subsector includes one industry that covers both musical groups and musical artists.</Definition>

Legislative activities, taxation, national defence, public order and safety, immigration services, foreign affairs and international assistance, and the administration of government programs are activities that are purely governmental in nature.

Ownership is not a criterion for classification. Government owned establishments engaged in activities that are not governmental in nature are classified to the same industry as privately owned establishments engaged in similar activities.

Government establishments may engage in a combination of governmental and non-governmental activities. When separate records are not available to separate the activities that are not governmental in nature from those that are, the establishment is classified to this sector.</Definition>
